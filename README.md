# Committee Tasks

This repository collects the tasks which come out of the All Committees Meetings.

Volunteer Committees lead their respective volunteer teams in the management of the charity's activities.
The ops manual describes the Committees in its section on the [Robotics Competition](https://opsmanual.studentrobotics.org/annual-robotics-competition).

See the full list of [issues](https://github.com/srobo/committee-tasks/issues) to see the lists of actions and their progress.

This repo's issues are aimed at members of the volunteer committees.
Individual volunteers are encouraged to instead look in the general [tasks](https://github.com/srobo/tasks) collection instead.
